Reading: Communicating Robot Motion Intent with Augmented reality.
- To solve the motion inference problem(team collebration in teams of human and robotics)
- recent work including natural language, lights signals, etc.
- In this paper, the AR device is introduced.

- communication among humans and robots getting harder when the degree of freedom in robots increases.
- more effective communication would enhances user perceptions of the robotâ€™s reliability, predictability, and transparency and may increase user willingness to accept and
use new robotic technologies in work environments
- Three features of AR interface:
    1. both real and virtual objects
    2. user acknowledgement of combination of real and virtual objects
    3. virtual objcets interact in realtime.
- claims research potential in human-robots interactions(modern equipments called augumented reality head-mounted displays, ARHMD)

- experiments design:
    1. augmenting the environment: with ARHMD, virtual imagery can be put in 3D "canvas" 
    2. augmenting the robot: generate indistinguishable cues for robots
    3. augmenting the UI: traditional AR application
- vitual objects in experiments:
    1. Navigation points
    2. Arrows(also for direction)
    3. Called 'Gaze', too many terminologies in robotics. seems toggle the robots' view?
    4. Utilities: for UI purposes

- Experiments is testing the quality different type of AR feedbacks
- Utilities does not help
- purpose of this research is to show the potential of ARHMD device can improve the interaction rather finding the best design. So of the design already indicates massive improvement compare to baseline(no AR environment help)
