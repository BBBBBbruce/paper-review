A Light-Field Journey to Virtual Reality
- immersive viewing experience -- virtual walk-in effect -- requires light-field technology: 3D imaging technology that emerged from the field of computational
imaging/photography to capture the light rays that people perceive from different locations and directions -- combining with machine learning and vision -- LF tech provides a viable path for producing low-cost, high-quality VR content -- most profitable(cool) in the VR industry
- Human visual perception: panoramic images + depth information
- in short, the collection of light rays that people perceive from different locations and directions in their surroundings is the light field.
- human eyes and brains are very sensitive. If our methods cannot be flawlessly, it would be caught by eyes and brains and result in uncomfortable symptoms.
- two subjects fixing this problem are computer vision and computational photography. 
- the innovation of light field camera enables eay acquisition of light fields. This resolves problems in computer vision and robotics, including stereo matching and 3D reconstruction, stereoscopy synthesis, saliency detection, so on and so forth(nouns I dont know).
- workshops into this fields by auther:
    1. LF4CV: www.eecis.udel.edu/yu/LF4CV/index.html (2014)
    2. CVPR 17
- the core issue of the light field VR technology is how to record the LF data and reproduce it without any loss of either geometric or photometric information. This can be done by camera array or LF camera(essentially the same thing)
- the light field is originally characterise as a 5D plenoptic function by Adelson and Bergen in 1991. and reduced to 4D by Levory and Hanrahan in 1996(just 2D camera array)
- The resulting light-field data can be conveniently used to render images from a new perspective, render images at different focus depths, or even increase the resolution and dynamic range of an image or the frame rate of a video.
- Using Levoyâ€™s two-plane light-field parameterization, you can render an image at a new focal depth according to the geometric relationships
- low-res of LF cam: super-resolution techniques not mature(deep-learning helps)
