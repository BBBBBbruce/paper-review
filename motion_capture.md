Papers found about motion capturing:
1. AMASS: Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes
    - deep learning: data-driven. However, existing human motion capture datasets are small and limited. Even though different datasets available, they all using unique parametrisation of the body -- hard to unify.
    - this paper propose a datasets(called AMASS). Unified 15 different optical marker-based motion capture(mocap) datasets with common framework and parametrisation.
    - the method is called MoSh++. it converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes.

2. self-supervised learning of motion capture
    - motion capture from single camera input(learning based method)
    - directly predict 3d shape and skeleton config(okay...)
    - 
3. Accuracy of human motion capture systems for sport applications; state-of-the-art review
    - biomechanical engineering 
    - help athelete to find the most suitable motion capture system
    - review 17 of human motion capture systems
    - not directly relevent
4. Design and Implementation of IMU-based Human Arm Motion Capture System
    - a tech paper, finding better motion capture system compare to the commercials.
    - 
5. FrankMocap: Fast Monocular 3D Hand and Body Motion Capture by Regression and Integration
    - monocular input, including hands skeleton details.
