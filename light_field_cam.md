The Light Field Camera: Extended Depth of Field, Aliasing, and Superresolution
(authors from UOE)
- in single snapshot, LF(plenoptic) cam enable digital image refocusing and 3D reconstruction
- they obtain a large depth of field but maintain the ability to reconstruct detail at high-res
- the essence of the LF cam is how they sample light field, trading off spatial versus angular resolution. Addtionally, aliasing. 
- terminology:
    1. digital image refocusing: adjust focus of the image after the image is taken
    2. depth of field: (from wiki) is the distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image.
- the traditional method of processing singleshot image would have to trade off depth maps vs. high-res. This paper propose a method to achieve both high-res and depth maps at the same time.
- math has maximum a posteriori, conjugate, matrices... bayesian stuff, skip for now, take too much time to recall(ug y4t2 probilistic inference lecture).

COMMENT:
Mathematically-heavy task.
too specific task for light field camera.
